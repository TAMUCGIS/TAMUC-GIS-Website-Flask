# TAMUC-GIS-Website-Flask
This is the TAMUC GIS Website, made with Python, using the Flask Microframework, with the Twitter Bootstrap Frontend library. This project is licensed under the BSD 3 Clause License. 
This website has a basis of the Club Affiliates, as well as the projects made by the group, and how to volunteer with their projects.


Update 8/8/17:
The website will have a web crawler addition, made with python, using beautiful soup, to add public domain data for the usage of map creation. 

The website will have a admin function, using flask admin, and will include the MongoDB database as a backend, for holding the GIS data. 

There is a discussion to change the GIS website, to the AGPL license, which will be discussed by the users of the site. 

There will be a possibility of creating a login service, to update the maps, for usage on the specific departments at the university. 

Weather will also be included in map form, based upon the national weather service. 

From a performance aspect, we will continue to use Flask, though some parts that are python, will possibly get updated in Cython.
